<hi>playing a concert</hi>
<p>playing a concert can be great fun! or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time</p>
<p>so we've put together a list of all our top tipes for great concerts.</p>
<h2>copy out a set-list</h2>
<p>a <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in order you'll play them.</p>
<p>make copies for everyone.</p>
<p>print it <strong>BIG!</strong> so that tou can still read it if it's down by you feet on the floor or if the lighting isn't very good.</p>
<h2>remember your spares.</h2>
<p>some instruments have parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or break.for example: </p>
<ul>
<li>guitar strings</li>
<li>saxophone or claranet reeds</li>
<li>drumsticks</li>
</ul>
<p>make a list of spares you might need and make sureyou know where thay are in an emergancy.</p>
<p>plan where you'll be on the stage.</p>
<p>before you start to set up the instruments, take a few minutes to decidewhere you're all going to be. </p>
<ul>
<li>Will the the drums be center stage .</li>
<li>Is there a power-socket for the amplifiresif your guitar player stands on th right?</li>
</ul>
<p>it's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your instruments. it's reallyannoying if you have to start unplugging things and swapping places once you've begun to set things up!</p>
<h2>know where you're going ,know when you're on</h2>
<p>if you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. print out a map or set the nav before you set out .there's nothing worse than being lost in an unfimiliar place half an hour before you're due to go-onstage.</p>
<p>and when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. on the night times often change .ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get cought out!</p>
